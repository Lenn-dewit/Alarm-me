# Alarm-me
Check if ambulances are around and give back alarm when they are in your radius.


You will need to install Ruby, node, socket and express.

For mac :

Download ruby : https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

Then install node: https://nodejs.org/download/

In the terminal, go to the directory and type in:

node index.js

And the server will listen on localhost:1337*

Good luck!
